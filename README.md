This is a session by session codes and requirements-appended version of CA Lab of UT for Spring 1401/1402 semester. 
The main objective of this repository is to help students to pass this lab easier, so in order to do that please consider that others may use this repo so make your code somehow customized.
It's highly recommended to write the codes yourself and just use this repo as a guide.
